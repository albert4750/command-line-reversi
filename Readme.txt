This is a simple reversi game written in C.

Reversi is a game played by two players, one using white pieces the other 
using black. The game starts with 4 pieces at the middle of the board. Players
would need to place pieces so that the piece they places would bound the 
opposite color's piece with another same color piece that is already on the 
board (ex. lets say a row is of form . . . B B W . . where '.' denotes empty,
then white can only place at the third dot so now its . . W B B W . .). The 
bounded color's pieces would then be changed to the color that it bounded, 
and players play until either no move could be made or the board is full.
The player with more of their color's piece wins.

User would be playing reversi against computer with one out of two algorithms
that user would be prompt to pick. (out of EASY and HARD)

Black would play first.
